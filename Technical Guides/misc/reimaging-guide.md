# Lab Drive Reimaging Guide

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for reimaging SATA/NVMe drives using the Reimaging Station in TechCentre. The process uses Clonezilla to restore lab workstation drives to a clean, standardized state with pre-configured Windows images.

{: .important-title }
> **Lab PCs ONLY**
>
> **CRITICAL:** This reimaging process is **ONLY** applicable to **Lab PCs/Workstations**. 
> - **DO NOT** use this process on student personal computers
> - **DO NOT** use this process on any non-lab equipment
>
> Lab images are specifically configured for lab environments and will not work properly on other systems. Reimaging personal or non-lab computers may result in system failure, data loss, and licensing issues.

{: .warning-title }
> **Reimaging is a Last Resort**
>
> **IMPORTANT:** Reimaging should only be performed as a **very last step** after all other troubleshooting methods have been exhausted. Before reimaging:
> - Attempt standard Windows troubleshooting (SFC scan, DISM)
> - Check for hardware issues (RAM, cables, connections)
> - Try startup repair and safe mode
> - Consult with Software FU members if unsure
>
> Reimaging completely erases the drive and should only be used when the system is unrecoverable through other means.

{: .important-title }
> **TechCentre Reimaging Station**
>
> This guide is specifically designed for use at the **Reimaging Station in TechCentre**. All necessary equipment, including the Clonezilla USB drive and SATA adapter, should be available at the station. Contact any Software FU member if any equipment is missing.

{: .note }
Currently, only SATA drives are supported due to adapter availability. NVMe support will be added once the appropriate adapters are obtained.

## Prerequisites

- **Verification that the system is a Lab PC** (not a personal computer)
- **Confirmation that reimaging is necessary** (all other troubleshooting has failed)
- Access to the Reimaging Station in TechCentre
- Clonezilla USB drive (provided at the station)
- SATA adapter (currently available at the station)
- The lab SSD drive to be reimaged (typically 1TB)
- Basic understanding of BIOS/boot menus

{: .warning }
**Data Loss Warning:** Reimaging will completely erase all data on the target drive. Ensure any important data is backed up before proceeding. This is an irreversible operation.
